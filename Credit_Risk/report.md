## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of running this analysis is to run final Machine Learning models to try and predict whether or not a loan may be considered low-risk or high-risk.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
  The first machine learning model predicted low-risk loans 100% of the time while high-risk loans were predicted 85% of the time.


* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
The second machine learning model predicted low-risk loans 100% of the time while high-risk loans were predicted 84% of the time.

## Summary

In summary the Logistic Regressio model that predicted only 4 non-healthy loans and 116 high-risk loans with the balanced data would be a better option in predicting what loans are at risk.
